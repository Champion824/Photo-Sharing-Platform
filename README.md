Instagram Clone
==========
Used [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for making a basic Instagram clone with Image sharing and profile updation features. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
